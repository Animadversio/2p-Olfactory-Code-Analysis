Perez-Orive et al. (2002) focused on a population of interneurons in the LH [LHIs, a subtype of LH neurons (LHNs)] that extends processes to the MB and appears to be GABAergic. Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB receive oscillatory waves of excitatory input directly from PNs; Perez-Orive et al. (2002) proposed the LHIs, which also receive this excitatory input from PNs, then feed it forward, after a brief delay, as inhibition to KCs. KCs would thus receive alternating waves of excitation from PNs and inhibition from LHIs, which together define temporal integration windows that help maintain the minimal and specific odor-elicited spiking observed in KCs.

What other functions might the LH serve? Because LHNs are fewer in number than and receive convergent input from PNs, we considered that LHNs might serve, in part, to extract general features of odorants. A computational model has suggested converging input from PNs could cause spikes in LHNs to occur with a phase preference that varied with, and thus contained information about, odor concentration ([Assisi et al., 2007](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/24/8138#ref-1)). To test this idea experimentally, we measured the phases of spiking relative to the LFP in LHNs that appear to receive convergent input from PNs (classes C1â€“C4).
