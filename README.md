# TODO List



Pingchuan says Shuang!
=======
Trial structure : for each stimuli 40ms before start, 15ms during stimuli, 60ms after stimuli.

# TODO List
* [x] Response matrix
* [ ] draw a distribution of the responsive neuron on z axis.
* [ ] Matrix factorization
  * [x] SVD (KN)
  * [ ] Non negative matrix factorization (NMF) (BX)   
* [ ] classify neuron based on their response to stimulus.
  * [ ] Hierachical clustering??? (based on distance) (BX)
  * [ ] K means (On response/off response ; PCA Dimension reduction ) (KN)
  * [ ] Plot cluster distribution on z axis
* [x] Draw the neurons population trajectory to the stimuli.(have done) (KN)
  * [x] SVD
  * [ ] LLE / non linear dimension reduction
