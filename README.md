# 2p-Olfactory-Code-Analysis

Collaborated work by Kaining Zhang, Pingchuan Ma, Binxu Wang

# Trial structure
Trial structure : for each stimuli 40ms before start, 15ms during stimuli, 60ms after stimuli.

# TODO List
* [ ] Examine the Odor and their natural functions
  * [ ] Odor and their receptor and their pathway
  * [x] EA, EB, MH are similar chemical (ester) is food odor
  * [x] 1-octen-3-ol
  * [x] Bzald (Benzaldehyde), Acet (Acetophenone)
* [x] Response matrix
* [x] draw a distribution of the responsive neuron on z axis.
* [ ] Matrix factorization
  * [x] SVD (KN)
  * [ ] Non negative matrix factorization (NMF) (BX)   
* [ ] classify neuron based on their response to stimulus.
  * [ ] Hierachical   clustering??? (based on distance) (BX)
  * [x] K means (On response/off response ; PCA Dimension reduction ) (KN)
  * [ ] Plot cluster distribution on z axis
* [x] Draw the neurons population trajectory to the stimuli.(have done) (KN)
  * [x] SVD
  * [ ] LLE / Other non linear dimension reduction

* [ ] Background research
  * [x] Anatomical location
  * [x] connectivity ~ Antennal lobe, Mushroom Body
    * [ ] Laminar structure?????
  * [ ] Computational function??????? (Expansion / compression????)
  * [ ] Function in sensory transformation ?
